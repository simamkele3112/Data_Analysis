CHRISTMAS TREE SALES DATA ANALYSIS:
This project focuses on analyzing the sales trends of real and fake Chrismas trees from 2010 to 2016.
The analysis was concluded using Python liberies such as Pandas for Data Manupulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.
The goal of this project is to understand consumers behaviour over the years by examining the number of tree sold, their average price, and the total revenue generated.


PROJECT STRUCTURE:
Data/ : contains the data set used for analysis
Notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks where the analysis was conducted.
SRC/ : Python scripts used to clean, manupulate and analysis the data
Visualization/ : Contains charts and graphs generated during the analysis

KEY STEPS IN THE PROJECT:
Data loading
Data cleaning
Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
Data manupulation
Data visualization

KEY INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS:
Real Trees: Although real trees sold more in terms of quantity in 2016, the total revenue generated by fake trees was nearly comparable due to high prices.
Fake trees: The price of Fake trees increased steadily, leading to high revenue dispite fewer units being sold compared to real trees.
Market trend: There is a clear market shift towards artificial trees, as they are higher price and convinience seems to attract more consumers.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Python 3.x
Pandas: data manupulation and analysis
Numpy: numerical operations
Matplotlib/seaborn: Data visualization

CONCLUSION:
This project helped analyze changing consumer preferences between real and fake trees. The analysis shows that while real trees remain popular in terms of units sold, fake trees generate substantial revenue due to higher average prices.
